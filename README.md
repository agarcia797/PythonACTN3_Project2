# PythonACTN3_Project2
Scientific Question: Is the ACTN3 gene sequences significantly different from the ACTN2 gene and is one more correlated with increased athletic performance?  Scientific Hypothesis: If the ACTN3 gene is correlated with increased endurance and sprint athletic performance, then the ACTN3 gene will be significantly different from ACTN2 gene which is expressed in non-athletes.
