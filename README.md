# PythonACTN3_Project2
This is a rough draft of my BIMM 143 Project 2 in Python.
Scientific Question: Is the ACTN3 gene sequences significantly different from the ACTN2 gene and is one more correlated with increased athletic performance?  Scientific Hypothesis: If the ACTN3 gene is correlated with increased endurance and sprint athletic performance, then the ACTN3 gene will be significantly different from ACTN2 gene which is expressed in non-athletes.
You will need a few files in order to adequately run the code: 

1) The jupyter notebook
2) The datasets for ACTN3 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/89) and ACTN2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/88) found in the NCBI database
3) Three txt files created from data in  “ACTN3 Genotype Is Associated with Human Elite Athletic Performance” by Nan Yang for male group (http://localhost:8888/edit/Desktop/BIMM%20143/ACTN3%20male.txt), female group (http://localhost:8888/edit/Desktop/BIMM%20143/ACTN3%20Female.txt), and total group (http://localhost:8888/edit/Desktop/BIMM%20143/ACTN3%20total.txt).
